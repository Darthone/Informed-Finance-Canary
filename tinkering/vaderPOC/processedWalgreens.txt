"The one remaining uncertainty is who buys the incremental boxes as it is not clear to us that FRED has the financing capacity to do so," Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said in a note.

Fred's confirmed that the previously agreed deal remained in effect and said it continued to work with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Rite Aid and Walgreens to complete the deal.

Walgreens said it would pay $7.00 per share if regulators required 1,000 stores or fewer to be divested and $6.50 per share for 1,200 stores, with the offer price being adjusted on a pro-rata basis for divestitures between 1,000-1,200 stores.
