Even if a general adjustment is approved it may exempt crude oil imports.\n\nBut the probability of a border adjustment on crude oil is not zero and if it happens it will help drive WTI to a premium over Brent.\n\nResearchers at Goldman Sachs put the probability of a border tax adjustment with no oil exemption being introduced at just 20 percent.\n\nBut if a tax adjustment is introduced it could result in an immediate appreciation of WTI relative to Brent of around 25 percent (\"Destination-based taxation and the oil market\", Goldman Sachs, Jan. 2017).\n\nSo it makes sense for hedge funds to prepare for the possibility by increasing their relative exposure to higher WTI rather than Brent prices.\n\nBorder tax advocates claim the impact of higher import costs and perceived subsidy for exports would be a rise in the real exchange rate of the U.S. dollar.\n\nA stronger dollar would in turn tend to depress the price of crude worldwide but the main impact would probably be felt on international grades linked to Brent.\n\nDomestic grades would benefit from the improvement in their competitive position and should be relatively insulated from any decline in international prices.\n\nSo even if a border tax adjustment depresses the dollar price of oil worldwide, other things being equal, it would still make sense to hold long positions in WTI rather than Brent.
