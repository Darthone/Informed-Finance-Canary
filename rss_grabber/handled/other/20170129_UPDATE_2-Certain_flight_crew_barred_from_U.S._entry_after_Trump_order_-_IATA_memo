Airlines also stand to lose business: for instance, around 35,000 travelers from Iran visited the United States in 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\"Much of this development has come over the weekend and at a time when IATA's Facilitation team has been on duty travel. Unfortunately, our response has been slower than we would have preferred,\" the email said. \"A number (of questions) have yet to be resolved.\"\n\nThe executive order by President Donald Trump bans travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days.\n\nIATA was informed that lawful permanent residents of the United States - or green-card holders - from those countries are not included in the ban.\n\nHowever, a Trump administration official told reporters that green-card holders from the countries need to check with a U.S. consulate to see whether they can return, causing some confusion for airlines, which still plan to follow CBP guidance.\n\nGulf airlines Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways said earlier on their websites that passengers would need a green card or diplomatic visa to enter the United States.\n\nAn Emirates spokeswoman said \"a very small number\" of its passengers had been affected by the ban.
