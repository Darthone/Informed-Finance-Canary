I think they should bring these factories under their control.\"\n\nBesides the squads, Beijing will set up a police force to specifically target environmental offences and polluting activities including open-air barbecues and garbage and biomass burning, the capital's acting mayor, Cai Qi, said this month.\n\nFor pollution graphic, click here: here\n\n(Editing by Ben Blanchard and Clarence Fernandez)", "date": "20170127", "epoch": "1485519415", "authors": ["Joseph Campbell"], "keywords": ["inspectors", "beijing", "26", "2017", "inspection", "wang", "beijings", "companies", "environmental", "polluting", "smog", "frontlines", "war", "pollution"], "tickers": []}
