{"title": "Alternative medicine might help treat premature ejaculation", "text": "Complementary and alternative medicine options may help men manage premature ejaculation, according to a new review of existing research.\n\nThe improvements were small, and the studies were of varying quality, but preliminary evidence suggests that acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Ayurvedic herbal medicine and a Korean topical cream may all have desirable effects, researchers conclude in the journal Sexual Medicine, online December 29.\n\n\u201cThere are a range of treatments available for premature ejaculation, including drug treatments, behavioral techniques and counseling, however, some men may not want to visit the doctor, take drugs long-term or be on a long wait list for counseling,\u201d said lead author Katy Cooper of the University of Sheffield in the UK.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to evaluate the evidence for other therapies,\u201d she told Reuters Health by email. \u201cTo our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to assess complementary and alternative medicine for premature ejaculation.\u201d\n\nIn the current study, researchers evaluated 10 randomized controlled trials that included comparisons either to another type of treatment or to a placebo. Two studies were of acupuncture, five were of Chinese herbal medicine, one of Ayurvedic herbal medicine and two of Korean topical \u201cseverance secret\u201d cream.\n\nTogether, the two acupuncture studies found that the treatment slightly increased intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) by about half a minute compared to placebo.\n\nChinese herbal medicine increased IELT by about two minutes, Ayurvedic herbal medicine increased IELT by nearly a minute and topical cream increased IELT by more than eight minutes.\n\nIn some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. For example, Chinese medicine paired with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increased IELT by two minutes longer than SSRIs alone and nearly three minutes longer than the Chinese medicine alone.\n\n\u201cThere are no approved treatments for premature ejaculation,\u201d said Donald Patrick, vice chair for research at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cThis is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,\u201d said Patrick, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cWe need treatments to address it, and it should be treated with equal seriousness as erectile dysfunction.\u201d\n\nThe prevalence of premature ejaculation is difficult to measure because of the differing definitions of the problem and some men\u2019s reluctance to report it. Some studies suggest that between 20 and 30 percent of men report early ejaculation concerns, but the International Society for Sexual Medicine estimates that about 4 percent of men have a lifelong condition.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is not openly discussed in the media - at least not as much as erectile problems have been discussed in the post-Viagra era - numerous studies report men feel frustrated, depressed and anxious because of this problem,\u201d said Ege Can Serefoglu of the Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nThe main limitation of the study is the underlying weakness of the studies evaluated. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the \u201cgold standard\u201d for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said.\n\nIn addition, the authors write, the studies are so different, it\u2019s tough to draw conclusions about the different options. For example, the five Chinese medicine studies tested different substances, including Qilin pills, Yimusake and Uighur.\n\nSome studies, but not all, discussed side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, mild pain and decreased libido. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.\n\n\u201cNowadays, I am encountering alternative medicine-obsessed patients more than I used to, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to argue with them about the treatment they want,\u201d Serefoglu told Reuters Health by email. \u201cAfter all, the placebo is a well-known clinical phenomenon, and some of my patients report surprisingly favorable outcomes.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2kCpsdv\n\nSex Med 2016.", "date": "20170128", "epoch": "1485622756", "authors": ["Carolyn Crist"], "keywords": ["help", "chinese", "ejaculation", "men", "treatments", "premature", "herbal", "ielt", "treat", "medicine", "alternative", "studies", "increased"], "tickers": []}
