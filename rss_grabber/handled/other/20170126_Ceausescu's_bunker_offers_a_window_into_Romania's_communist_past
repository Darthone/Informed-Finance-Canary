Peacocks walk in the garden - descendants of a pair Ceausescu brought in after seeing some during a visit to Japan in the 1970s. A chess board with intricate wooden pieces has pawns carved to look like peasants.\n\nThe villa was ransacked during the revolution of 1989, but protesters did surprisingly little damage, Iliescu said.\n\nCeausescu, who would have been 99 on Thursday, was summarily tried and shot by firing squad along his wife on Dec. 25, 1989, the only Cold War-era communist dictator to be executed.\n\nUp to 2 million people are believed to have been killed, imprisoned, deported or relocated in Romania between 1945 and 1989.\n\nWhile his residence may look like an ornate, marbled time capsule from the 1980s, the country still bears the scars of his regime 27 years later.\n\nRomania joined the European Union in 2007, but remains its second-poorest state, with entrenched bureaucracy and corruption that date back to those times.\n\nMany communist-era officials are still in public life, wielding political and business influence. The government is still returning properties seized under communism to their owners, a process other countries in the region finished long ago.\n\nIn 2016, a court sentenced a 90-year-old prison commander, Alexandru Visinescu, for crimes against humanity, the first case of its kind.
