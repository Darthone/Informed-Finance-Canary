REUTERS/Mark Makela\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. Senator John McCain said on Sunday that President Donald Trump's order targeting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries has been \"confusing\" and raised a number of questions.\n\n\"It's been a very confusing process,\" McCain, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS' 'Face the Nation.' McCain said the effect of Trump's immigration order \"will probably, in some areas, give ISIS (Islamic State) some more propaganda,\" and asked why the countries targeted by the order included Iraq, where U.S. forces are fighting alongside Iraqi forces against Islamic State.\n\nMcCain said he was \"worried\" about the addition of Trump's chief strategist and former campaign chief Steve Bannon to the U.S. National Security Council. McCain said this was \"a radical departure from any national security council in history.\"\n\n(Reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)", "date": "20170129", "epoch": "1485729300", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "keywords": ["john", "trump", "national", "immigration", "mccain", "islamic", "trumps", "senator", "security", "republican", "order", "confusing"], "tickers": []}
