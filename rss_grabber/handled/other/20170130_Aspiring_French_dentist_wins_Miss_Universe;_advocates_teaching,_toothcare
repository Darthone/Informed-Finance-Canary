It's about being comfortable with who we are,\" she was quoted as saying in a media interview.\n\nIt was the third time for the Philippines to host the pageant, and its major local sponsor, tycoon Luis Singson, paid $13 million in a one-off deal to bring the contest to the country.\n\n(Editing by Martin Petty, Robert Birsel)", "date": "20170130", "epoch": "1485789339", "authors": ["Enrico Dela Cruz"], "keywords": ["mittenaere", "iris", "pageant", "metro", "miss", "aspiring", "wins", "philippines", "mall", "french", "france", "dentist", "advocates", "asia", "universe", "teaching", "toothcare"], "tickers": []}
