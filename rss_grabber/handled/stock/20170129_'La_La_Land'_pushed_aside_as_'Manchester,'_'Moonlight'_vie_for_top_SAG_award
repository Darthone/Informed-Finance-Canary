All went on to win Oscars in their respective categories.\n\nAmy Adams, who has garnered praise for her role as a linguist in the sci-fi alien film \"Arrival,\" was one of the biggest surprise snubs in the Oscar best actress race this year, but she will be vying for the SAG accolade.\n\nShe will be competing against \"La La Land\" star Emma Stone, Meryl Streep for \"Florence Foster Jenkins,\" Natalie Portman for \"Jackie\" and Emily Blunt for \"The Girl on the Train.\"\n\nIn SAG's best actor race, Affleck, the current front-runner, will face \"La La Land\" star Ryan Gosling, Andrew Garfield for \"Hacksaw Ridge,\" Viggo Mortensen for \"Captain Fantastic\" and \"Fences\" star Denzel Washington.\n\n(Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "date": "20170129", "epoch": "1485728084", "authors": ["Nichola Groom", "Piya Sinha-roy"], "keywords": ["land", "star", "la", "oscar", "vie", "sag", "aside", "award", "moonlight", "pushed", "race", "manchester", "film", "sea", "awards", "best"], "tickers": ["L"]}
