REUTERS/ Ali Jarekji/File Photo\n\nDUBAI/KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia/LONDON The first independent audit of Saudi Aramco's [IPO-ARMO.SE] oil reserves has confirmed the state oil company's own figures, sources familiar with the situation said, ahead of its planned share market listing next year.\n\nThe listing, expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO), is a centerpiece of a Saudi Arabian government plan to transform the country by enticing investment and diversifying the economy away from oil.\n\nBased on a figure of 265 billion barrels, Aramco's fields contain about 15 percent of the world's proven reserves. Any finding that the reserves are significantly above or below that could affect the company's market value in the listing.\n\n\"The independent audit produced no surprises,\" a source familiar with the situation said on Friday. \"Aramco's reserves have always been reported internally in line with international practice.\"\n\nAramco had asked two U.S. oil reserve auditing specialists to review its deposits.\n\nThese are Gaffney, Cline and Associates, part of Baker Hughes and Dallas-based DeGolyer and MacNaughton. DeGolyer and MacNaughton completed its audit last year, two of the sources said.\n\nAramco and DeGolyer could not be reached for immediate comment on Friday. Gaffney Cline also could not be reached for immediate comment.\n\nSaudi Arabia's proven oil reserves have been listed at about 265 billion barrels in oil industry reference publications such as the BP Statistical Review of World Energy for many years.\n\nAramco said its crude oil and condensate reserves were 261.1 billion barrels in its 2015 annual report.\n\nThe reserves audit produced figures \"definitely not below\" those published by Aramco, a second source familiar with the matter said, while a third source said the auditing firm's estimate was higher than Aramco's own.\n\nThe IPO plan is being championed by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees energy and economic policy in the world's top oil-exporting country.\n\nPrince Mohammed has said he expects the IPO, which will offer up to five percent of the company, to value Aramco at a minimum of $2 trillion.\n\nSenior oil industry figures have welcomed the Aramco IPO for casting more light on Saudi Arabia's oil reserves. Many of the world's biggest sovereign reserves holders have not changed their numbers for years.\n\nThe head of Russian oil company Rosneft Igor Sechin said last year the Aramco listing would give transparency over reserves data which had not been updated for 30 years.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov in London; Editing by Jane Merriman)", "date": "20170127", "epoch": "1485542542", "authors": ["Rania El Gamal Reem Shamseddine Alex Lawler"], "keywords": ["audit", "worlds", "confirmed", "oil", "source", "ipo", "aramco", "sources", "reserves", "external", "listing", "aramcos", "saudi"], "tickers": ["IPO"]}
