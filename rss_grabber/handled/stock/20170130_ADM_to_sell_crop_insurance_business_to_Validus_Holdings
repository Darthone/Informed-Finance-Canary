REUTERS/Karl Plume\n\nCHICAGO U.S. agricultural commodities trader Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) has agreed to sell its Crop Risk Services (CRS) insurance business for $127.5 million to Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N), the companies announced on Monday.\n\nThe deal, which is expected to close in the first half of this year pending a regulatory review, includes a services agreement under which ADM will continue to offer insurance products and grain marketing services to CRS customers, the company said.\n\nADM said it expects to record a book gain upon closing.\n\nThe sale comes amid a commodities market downturn that has squeezed margins for ADM and other agribusinesses and prompted divestments of lower-margin and noncore businesses.\n\nRival Cargill Inc sold its crop insurance unit in December 2015. ADM is in the process of selling its ethanol-producing corn dry mills amid persistently weak margins.\n\n\"We regularly evaluate our portfolio to ensure that our businesses and assets best fit our strategy to maximize long-term returns,\" said Joe Taets, president of ADM's Agricultural Services unit.\n\n\"As a result of that ongoing process, we have identified a better strategic fit for the Crop Risk Services business,\" he said.\n\nADM shares closed down 0.9 percent at $44.13 on Monday, a week ahead of the release of fourth-quarter results. Validus shares were down 0.7 percent at $56.51.\n\n(Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "date": "20170130", "epoch": "1485834138", "authors": ["Karl Plume"], "keywords": ["sell", "saidadm", "midland", "risk", "business", "holdings", "crop", "validus", "shares", "services", "process", "adm", "insurance"], "tickers": ["VR.N", "ADM.N", "CRS"]}
