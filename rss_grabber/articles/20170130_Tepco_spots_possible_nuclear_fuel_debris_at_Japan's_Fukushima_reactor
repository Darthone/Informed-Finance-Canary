Many of those people are unlikely to return.\n\nIt took Tepco about two months to admit the reactors had melted down, confirming what experts had been saying for weeks.\n\nTepco has made some progress, such as removing hundreds of spent fuel rods in one of the damaged buildings. But it has failed to establish the location of the melted fuel rods in the other three damaged reactors at the plant.\n\nThe utility has been developing robots that can swim under water and negotiate obstacles in damaged tunnels and piping to search for the melted fuel rods.\n\nBut as soon as the robots get close to the reactors, the radiation destroys their wiring and renders them useless.\n\nIn December, the government nearly doubled its projections for costs related to the Fukushima nuclear disaster to 21.5 trillion yen ($188 billion), increasing pressure on Tepco to step up reforms and improve its performance.\n\nPlans to remove spent nuclear fuel located high in the damaged building of the No. 3 reactor have been delayed again, the Nikkei business daily reported on Thursday.\n\n($1 = 114.6200 yen)\n\n(Reporting by Yuka Obayashi, Makiko Yamazaki and Chris Gallagher; Writing by Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Tom Hogue, Robert Birsel)", "keywords": ["japans", "damaged", "reactor", "power", "tokyo", "nuclear", "melted", "possible", "spots", "fuel", "debris", "fukushima", "tepco", "electric"], "epoch": "1485794790", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "date": "20170130"}
