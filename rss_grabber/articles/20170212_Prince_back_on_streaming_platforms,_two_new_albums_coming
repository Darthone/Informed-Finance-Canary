Sunday's announcement covers streaming for his music through 1996.\n\n\"When we make any of Prince's music available to fans -- from the hits to unreleased gems -- we are committed to upholding Prince's high creative standards,\" Cameron Strang, chief executive of Warner Bros. Records, said in Sunday's statement.\n\nThe streaming deal was reached with the agreement of Prince's estate and covers platforms such as Amazon Music, Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora.\n\n(Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "keywords": ["princes", "streaming", "purple", "sundays", "musician", "bros", "platforms", "music", "rain", "coming", "albums", "prince", "warner"], "epoch": "1486956062", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "date": "20170212"}
