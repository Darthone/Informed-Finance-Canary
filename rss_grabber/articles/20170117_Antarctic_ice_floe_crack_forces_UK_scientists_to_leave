REUTERS/British Antarctic Survey/Handout\n\nLONDON The British Antarctic Society is recalling scientists from its Halley VI polar research base in March after a fissure developed in the ice sheet.\n\nThe decision was taken after a huge crack appeared in the Brunt Ice Shelf, just 10 miles away from the Halley VI research station.\n\n\"We want to do the right thing for our people,\u201d said Captain Tim Stocking, Director of Operations at the British Antarctic Society (BAS).\n\n\"Bringing them home for winter is a prudent precaution given the changes that our glaciologists have seen in the ice shelf in recent months.\"\n\nThere are currently 88 scientists stationed at the Halley VI research centre, which monitors climate data and played a key role in discovering the ozone hole in 1986.\n\nThe station is currently undergoing a process of relocation, after a fissure - once thought to be dormant \u2013 began encroaching on the base in 2012, advancing a mile every year.\n\nBut the new site is faced with another huge chasm, which developed in October 2016.\n\nScientists from the center have been monitoring the chasm\u2019s development but cannot be sure whether a large iceberg will \"calve,\u2019 splitting away from the main ice shelf.\n\nAccording to the BAS, the risk of this happening is low and the decision to pull scientists form the research station was made as a precautionary measure.\n\nIf the ice fractured during summer months, an evacuation could be swiftly mounted. But the forthcoming Antarctic winter complicates things, bringing 24-hour darkness and frozen seas, making evacuation an extremely complex process.\n\nScientists will return to their duties at the research center once winter has passed.\n\n(Reporting by Luke Bridges; editing by Stephen Addison)", "keywords": ["forces", "halley", "vi", "scientists", "ice", "research", "leave", "station", "british", "uk", "crack", "shelf", "antarctic", "floe", "winter"], "epoch": "1484687981", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "date": "20170117"}
