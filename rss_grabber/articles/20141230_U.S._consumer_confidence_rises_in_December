REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nU.S. consumer confidence increased in December, bolstered by a brightening jobs situation that left perceptions about economic conditions at a high last seen in February 2008, according to a private sector report released on Tuesday.\n\nThe Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 92.6 from an upwardly revised 91.0 the month before. Economists expected a reading of 93.0 for December, according to a Reuters poll.\n\nNovember was originally reported as 88.7.\n\n\"Consumer confidence rebounded modestly in December, propelled by a considerably more favorable assessment of current economic and labor market conditions,\" Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement. \"... They are more confident at year-end than they were at the beginning of the year.\"\n\nThe expectations index in December was 88.5 versus November's revised 89.3, and the present situation index rose to 98.6 from a revised 93.7 in November.
