Beckham caught six passes for 93 yards as the NFC out-gained the AFC 353-241 in yards.\n\nAfter playing the first scoreless quarter in a Pro Bowl in 10 years, the teams finally cracked the seal in the second.\n\nThe AFC found the end zone on the quarter's first play, with Kansas City's Alex Smith finding Tennessee tight end Delanie Walker on a 26-yard touchdown pass down the left side.\n\nNew Orleans' Drew Brees tied the score at 7-7 when he connected with Seattle's Doug Baldwin on a 47-yard scoring strike with 6:26 left in the half.\n\nThe NFC failed to convert on two chances inside the AFC five-yard line, as Dallas rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott was stuffed on a fourth-and-goal in the first quarter and Brees was intercepted in the end zone early in the second.\n\nThe AFC took a 14-7 lead at halftime as Cincinnati's Andy Dalton flipped a 23-yard touchdown pass to Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce, who got behind Minnesota's Harrison Smith on a crossing pattern with 1:40 remaining.\n\n(Editing by John O'Brien)", "keywords": ["firm", "kansas", "nfc", "stands", "pro", "lowscoring", "bowl", "afc", "tight", "quarter", "yards", "pass", "touchdown", "end", "hold"], "epoch": "1485770236", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "date": "20170130"}
