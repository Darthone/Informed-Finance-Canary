REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd said on Monday a U.S. court rejected four of the Israel-based drugmaker's claims of patent infringement on its top-selling multiple sclerosis treatment.\n\nThe rejection comes four months after U.S. patent officials invalidated three patents on its drug Copaxone, in response to challenges by pharmaceutical company Mylan NV, which has been trying to market a generic version of the drug.\n\nAll asserted claims of Teva were invalid, the U.S. District Court Of Delaware said in a ruling on Monday.\n\nThe patents, which expire in 2030, cover a 40-milligram injection of Copaxone that patients administer three times a week.\n\nGenerics may only be sold after a drug's patents expire or are invalidated through litigation.\n\nHowever, Teva said it planned to appeal the decision.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Teva were down almost 9 percent in after-hours trading, while Mylan's shares edged up marginally.\n\n(Reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Rigby)", "keywords": ["industries", "pharmaceutical", "court", "rejects", "patentinfringement", "invalidated", "copaxone", "patent", "teva", "expire", "tevas", "shares", "claims", "patents"], "epoch": "1485841865", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "date": "20170131"}
