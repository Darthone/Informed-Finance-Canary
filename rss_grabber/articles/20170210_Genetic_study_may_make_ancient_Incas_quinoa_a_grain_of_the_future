But the presence of toxic and bitter chemicals called saponins in its seeds has been one of the impediments to extensive cultivation.\n\nPlant scientist Mark Tester of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia said the research pinpointed a gene that guides production of saponins in quinoa. This knowledge could enable breeding of quinoa without saponins, to make the seeds sweeter.\n\nCurrently, quinoa grain must be processed through washing and drying after harvest to remove saponins.\n\n\"Quinoa is currently greatly under-utilized,\" said Tester, who led the research published in the journal Nature. \"It is highly nutritious, with a high protein content that, importantly, has a very good balance of amino acids, which is unusual for our major grains. It is gluten free and high in vitamins and minerals, too.\"\n\nIncreased quinoa production could improve food security on a planet with unrelenting human population growth, Tester said.\n\nThere are potential disadvantages to reducing saponins, perhaps increasing susceptibility to fungal infections or bird predation, Tester added.\n\nQuinoa, which boasts a nutty flavor, can be used the same ways as rice and wheat. It can be cooked and served on its own, turned into pasta, put in soups, eaten as a cereal or fermented to make beer or chicha, a beverage of the Andes.\n\nThe crop was sacred to the ancient Incas, who called it \"chisoya mama,\" or the \"mother grain.\"\n\nDuring their South American conquest 500 years ago, Spaniards suppressed quinoa cultivation because of its use in indigenous religious ceremonies. They forbade quinoa cultivation for a time, with the Incas forced to grow wheat instead.\n\nQuinoa is still a minor crop globally, grown mostly in Peru and Bolivia. It has become fashionable in the West in recent years, primarily as a health food.\n\nSOURCE: go.nature.com/2ll88hS Nature, online February 8, 2017.", "keywords": ["ancient", "wheat", "grains", "tester", "incas", "study", "high", "quinoa", "genetic", "future", "grain", "sacred", "saponins", "seeds", "suppressed", "south"], "epoch": "1486708148", "authors": ["Will Dunham"], "date": "20170210"}
