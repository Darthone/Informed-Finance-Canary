Boeing has also put three of its 787 Dreamliners in museums.\n\n\"Museums are not just about preserving the past; they are also a window on the future,\" said Jacques Rocca, president of the Airitage association, set up to preserve Airbus artefacts.\n\nSHOW-STOPPER\n\nIn the 1990s, Airbus's vision of the future was a super-capacity airliner able to revolutionize air travel and displace the profitable 747 by linking the world's largest travel hubs.\n\nBoeing disagreed and later developed the smaller 787, though it hedged its bets by updating the 747, with disappointing results.\n\nSince 2005, the A380 superjumbo has been a show-stopper at events like the Paris Airshow, yards from the aerospace museum at Le Bourget. Airbus and Dubai's Emirates, the largest A380 operator, say its roomy cabin is a hit with passengers.\n\nDespite this, the A380 has not proved as popular with fleet planners because of the risks of being unable to fill it up in a fragile economy, as well as advances in twin-jet design.\n\nAirbus sees demand for 1,264 very large jets like the A380 and 747-8 over 20 years: higher than Boeing's forecast of 530.\n\nBut it is also expected to confirm in its annual results next week that the A380 will go back into loss after its biggest customer Emirates deferred some deliveries this year. An Airbus spokesman reaffirmed the company's delivery targets.\n\n(Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Keith Weir)", "keywords": ["airbus", "le", "747", "paris", "museum", "bourget", "a380", "air", "superjumbo", "near", "future", "gets"], "epoch": "1487104938", "authors": ["Tim Hepher"], "date": "20170214"}
