They treated the diamonds with a special process to keep them from cracking, a problem that has foiled prior experiments.\n\n\"This is just at the point when the diamonds are about to crack,\" Ceperley said. \"That is why it's taken so long. Silvera had new ways of shaping the diamonds and polishing them so they wouldn't break.\"\n\nA key question is whether the pressurized hydrogen maintains its metallic properties at room temperature, which would make it extremely useful as a superconductor.\n\nBoth Ceperley and Silvera believe this will be the case, but it still needs to be proven.\n\n(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)", "keywords": ["ceperley", "used", "extremely", "create", "youre", "possible", "ending", "quest", "square", "silvera", "scientists", "taken", "metallic", "hydrogen", "diamonds", "superconductor"], "epoch": "1485477618", "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen"], "date": "20170126"}
