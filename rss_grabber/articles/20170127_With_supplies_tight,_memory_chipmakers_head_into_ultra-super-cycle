Alibaba-backed Meizu said it has no problems in its smartphone launch or shipment plans. \"We have a long-term agreement with our suppliers that ... guarantees more than 3 months of supply at any given moment,\" global branding manager Ard Boudeling told Reuters.\n\nDistributors, however, say tight supplies mean there are some severe shipping delays.\n\n\"So much so that many are active in the secondary market to procure the needed supply, often at large premiums to contract pricing,\" said Tobey Gonnerman, executive vice president at U.S.-based component distributor Fusion Worldwide.\n\nHe said there are delivery delays of 8-12 weeks for certain chips, and, in some extreme cases, no delivery date confirmations at all.\n\nThat's likely to push up prices further, with Nomura predicting global memory chip market revenue will grow 56.7 percent this year to a record $116 billion.\n\nSK Hynix Vice President Sean Kim said customers resisted the price hikes in contract negotiations for the first half, \"but ultimately, negotiations were concluded at much higher prices.\"\n\n\"I think they expected prices wouldn't fall significantly even in the second half, and decided to build their inventory in advance,\" he added.\n\nDEEP POCKETS\n\nSamsung appears best placed to benefit from the market cycle given its early and heavy investment in new technology, particularly in 3D NAND chips, which are in demand from high-end storage products used in data servers.\n\nSK Hynix says it is still a year behind Samsung in this technology, but hopes to close the gap this year. Toshiba said it is still months behind Samsung in producing 3D NAND chips.\n\n\"The advantage Samsung has over everyone is simply their investment,\" said a person at one of the South Korean giant's competitors, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media. \"Their projected investment in 3D NAND this year, according to analysts, is bigger than our entire capex plan for the year.\"\n\nSamsung spent 10.6 trillion won on memory chip capex last year, and has yet to announce spending plans for this year.\n\nThe shift to next-generation technologies is not just costly, it has also created production bottlenecks.\n\nBNP estimates memory capital spending in 2016-17 will be 80 percent more than was spent four years ago, but returns on those investments are diminishing: $1 billion spent this year will grow shipments by around only a third of what chipmakers would have recouped from the same amount in 2012-13, BNP said.\n\nSamsung expects global NAND chip supply will grow by around 30 percent, while Nomura expects demand to rise by 42 percent.\n\n\"They (chipmakers) are now in the enviable position to choose what to make and who to sell to, and raise pricing levels even further,\" said Fusion Worldwide's Gonnerman.\n\n\"They seem to have the luxury of choosing where to focus their production, and wherever they choose will result in growing the shortages on other product families.\"\n\n(Reporting by Se Young Lee, with additional reporting by Makiko Yamazaki in TOKYO and Sijia Jang in HONG KONG; Writing by Miyoung Kim; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)", "keywords": ["hynix", "head", "samsung", "chip", "supply", "nand", "chipmakers", "ultrasupercycle", "tight", "inventory", "memory", "supplies", "chips", "price"], "epoch": "1485531742", "authors": ["Se Young Lee"], "date": "20170127"}
