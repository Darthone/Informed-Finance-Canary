{"title": "Do doctors spend too much time with computers?", "text": "(Reuters Health) - For every hour that some doctors devote to direct patient care they may spend about five hours on other tasks, often because they\u2019re tied up with computer work, a Swiss study suggests.\n\nThe results are based on observations of just 36 doctors-in-training at one hospital in Switzerland. But research dating back more than half a century has documented physicians dedicating a similar amount of their workdays to direct patient care, said Dr. Nathalie Wenger, lead author of the current study.\n\n\u201cIt has not really changed in 50 years,\u201d Wenger, a researcher at the University Hospital of Lausanne, said by email.\n\nDuring the study period, the doctors spent an average of 1.7 hours per shift with patients, 5.2 hours using computers and 13 minutes doing both, Wenger and colleagues report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nPatient care might not necessarily be better if doctors had less screen time, but cutting back could still have some advantages, Wenger said.\n\n\u201cIt will clearly improve satisfaction of physicians, reduce their stress and improve medical education by freeing up time for that,\u201d Wenger said.\n\nFor the current study, Wenger and colleagues observed medical residents for a total of about 698 hours.\n\nTeams of observers recorded the residents\u2019 activities throughout their shifts at the hospital, sorting tasks into one of 22 different categories such as direct or indirect patient care, communication, academic or nonmedical work.\n\nDay shifts typically lasted 11.6 hours, or 1.6 hours longer than scheduled, the study found.\n\nDuring day shifts, doctors spent about 52 percent of their time on activities indirectly related to patients such as writing in medical records, collaborating with other clinicians, looking for information needed to treat patients and handing off care to other providers.\n\nPhysicians spent about 28 percent of their day shifts on direct patient care including clinical exams and medical procedures and rounds done as part of the residency program to review treatment with colleagues.\n\nThey spent only about 2 percent of their time communicating with patients and families, and about 6 percent of their time either teaching, receiving training or doing academic research.\n\nDuring shifts, physicians spent up to about 45 percent of their time on computers, the study found.\n\nBeyond its small size and single site, other limitations of the study include the fact that residents knew they were being observed and may have adjusted their work accordingly, the authors note.\n\nIt also wasn\u2019t an experiment designed to prove how different uses of physician time influence patient outcomes.\n\nStill, the findings add to a growing body of research documenting how much of doctors\u2019 time is taken up by administrative tasks, said Dr. Susan Thompson Hingle, a researcher at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine in Springfield who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cHaving observed residents and talked with residents, I do not think the findings are unique to the Swiss,\u201d Hingle said by email. \u201cIt seems as though the studies continue to confirm the enormous administrative tasks that physicians and physicians in training, regardless of level, clinical venue, or geographic location, are faced with.\u201d\n\nPatients often complain that doctors don\u2019t spend enough time with them and that physicians spend more time focused on the computer than on them, Hingle said.\n\n\u201cWhen our attention is not on the patient, we miss important non-verbal cues; we are distracted and not actively listening; we miss opportunities to build a trusting, healing relationship with our patient,\u201d Hingle added. \u201cWithout that trust, patient adherence is less which impacts patient outcomes, and patient satisfaction is less, which also impacts patient outcomes.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2fazTFW Annals of Internal Medicine, online January 30, 2017.", "keywords": ["physicians", "patient", "study", "computers", "spent", "hours", "shifts", "wenger", "doctors", "residents", "spend", "care"], "epoch": "1485833435", "authors": ["Lisa Rapaport"], "date": "20170130"}
