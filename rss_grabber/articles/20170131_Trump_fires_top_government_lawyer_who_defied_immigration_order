REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump fired the federal government's top lawyer Sally Yates on Monday after she took the extraordinarily rare step of defying the White House and refused to defend new travel restrictions targeting seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nYates said late on Monday that the Justice Department would not defend in court Trump's directive that put a 120-day hold on allowing refugees into the country, an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria and a 90-day bar on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nYates said she did not believe defending the order would be \"consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.\"\n\nHours later, she was fired. The White House said Yates \"has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States\" and portrayed her actions as political.\n\nTrump has argued tougher vetting of immigrants is needed to protect America from terror attacks but critics complain that his order unfairly singles out Muslims and defiles America's historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants.\n\nYates, an appointee of former Democratic President Barack Obama, was days away from being replaced by Trump's pick for the top spot at the Justice Department, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, who is awaiting Senate confirmation.\n\n\"Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe White House said that Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, would be acting U.S. attorney general until Sessions is approved.\n\nBoente said in an interview with the Washington Post that he would enforce the immigration order.\n\nThere have been only a handful of instances in U.S. history of top Justice Department officials publicly breaking with the White House.\n\nThe most famous example was in 1973, when then-Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy resigned rather than obey President Richard Nixon\u2019s order to fire a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.\n\nThe incident, which became known as the 'Saturday Night Massacre,' was a public relations disaster and is seen as a turning point in Nixon's administration.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco, Doina Chiacu, Arshad Mohammed, Susan Heavey, Mark Hosenball and Patricia Zengerle in Washington, Jonathan Allen in New York, Brian Snyder in Boston, and Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento; Writing by Roberta Rampton and Alistair Bell; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Bill Rigby)", "keywords": ["trump", "donald", "airport", "travel", "executive", "immigration", "fires", "trumps", "lawyer", "international", "ban", "president", "2017", "order", "defied"], "epoch": "1485849046", "authors": ["Roberta Rampton"], "date": "20170131"}
