{"title": "Manchester United appoint counter-terrorism manager", "text": "LONDON Manchester United have appointed a full-time counter-terrorism manager in what they believe to be a first in English club soccer.\n\nBritish media reported that the Premier League club had hired a former inspector from Greater Manchester Police's specialist search unit.\n\nThe Manchester Evening News said the new chief had started work \"alongside the club\u2019s current senior security team, with an emphasis on counter-terrorism and general security improvements\".\n\nThe appointment of the unnamed officer at one of the world's biggest and best-supported clubs comes amid heightened global concern after recent attacks in Europe and security breaches at United.\n\nTwo stands at the 75,000-seater Old Trafford ground were evacuated just before the start of a league game against Bournemouth in May when a suspicious package was found in the toilets.\n\nThe game was called off soon afterwards and the stadium cleared. The package was later revealed to be a fake device accidentally left behind after a training exercise.\n\nTwo fans on an official tour of the ground in November managed to hide in a toilet and stay in the stadium overnight in the hope of watching a Premier League game against Arsenal.\n\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond)", "keywords": ["appoint", "league", "united", "stadium", "counterterrorism", "premier", "game", "package", "manager", "manchester", "clubs", "security", "ground"], "epoch": "1484807230", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "date": "20170119"}
