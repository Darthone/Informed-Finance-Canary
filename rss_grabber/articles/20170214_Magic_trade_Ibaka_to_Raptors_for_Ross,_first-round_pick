Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports\n\n(The Sports Exchange) - Serge Ibaka is headed north of the border after the Orlando Magic agreed to trade the three-time All-Defensive First Teamer to the Toronto Raptors for Terrence Ross and a 2017 first-round pick, The Vertical reported Tuesday.\n\nIbaka was traded to the Magic last offseason after spending his first seven seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder. The 27-year-old averaged 15.1 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in 56 games with Orlando.\n\nDuring his time with the Thunder, Ibaka led the league in blocked shots twice (2012, 2013) and averaged 11.6 points, 7.4 boards and 2.5 swats in 524 games while helping lead Oklahoma City to an appearance in the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Magic were reportedly concerned about their ability to retain Ibaka, who is set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer.\n\nIbaka and Raptors president Masai Ujiri have a longstanding relationship, and Ibaka loves the city of Toronto, according to Ryan Wolstat of the Toronto Sun.\n\nRoss, 26, is averaging 10.4 points through 54 games in his fifth season in Toronto.\n\nThe Raptors (32-23) are six games behind the Cleveland Cavaliers for the top spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\n(Editing by Steve Keating in Toronto)", "keywords": ["toronto", "city", "magic", "firstround", "trade", "points", "games", "pick", "forward", "2017", "ibaka", "raptors", "today", "ross"], "epoch": "1487111062", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "date": "20170214"}
