Lots of snow, well prepared tracks, real frosty winter weather, marvelous,\" Czech musher Roman Habasko said.\n\nThe event is named after a Siberian Huskey called Sedivak, who was shot by a local resident after running off before the start of the first ever race.\n\nPolice have been deployed along the route to ensure safety for dogs and participants, with helpers handing out hot drinks to mushers as temperatures fall below minus four degrees Celsius (24F).\n\n(Writing by Patrick Johnston in LONDON; Editing by Susan Fenton)", "keywords": ["mountains", "trek", "winter", "czech", "snow", "annual", "hot", "dog", "sled", "teams", "charge", "race", "tracks", "fall", "weather", "mushers", "dogs"], "epoch": "1485493070", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "date": "20170126"}
