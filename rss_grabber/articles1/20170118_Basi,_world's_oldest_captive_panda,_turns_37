China Daily/via REUTERS\n\nBEIJING Basi, the oldest giant panda living in captivity, celebrated her 37th birthday on Wednesday wearing a crown and getting a special birthday cake.\n\nTourists eagerly snapped photos as Basi, whose age is equivalent to 140 human years, slurped a soup of maize flour and eggs from a cake-shaped bowl at the Fuzhou Giant Panda Research Centre in southern China.\n\nThe panda can only be fed liquids and a small amount of bamboo leaves, state broadcaster CCTV said.\n\nBasi has high blood pressure and needed cataract surgery several years ago, but overall she was in good health, CCTV said.\n\nAlthough the International Union for the Conservation of Nature downgraded the giant panda's status to \"vulnerable\" from \"endangered\" in September last year, the species still relies on conservation programs, conservationists say.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters Television; Editing by Darren Schuettler)", "keywords": ["province", "worlds", "giant", "turns", "fuzhou", "37", "eats", "captive", "birthday", "china", "oldest", "panda", "fujian", "basi"], "epoch": "1484756791", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "date": "20170118"}
