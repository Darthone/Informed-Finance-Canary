REUTERS/Gary Cameron\n\nTOKYO Asian shares edged lower on Thursday and the dollar rebounded after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen hinted that interest rates in the United States could rise quickly this year.\n\nThe dollar had been grinding lower in recent sessions, dropping to its weakest levels since early December after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expressed concerns about a stronger greenback.\n\nInvestors have also remained anxious ahead of Trump's inauguration on Friday, with many using it as an excuse to take some money off the table.\n\nYellen said in a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California in San Francisco on Wednesday that holding off too long to begin raising rates could \"risk a nasty surprise down the road,\" and that it \"makes sense\" for the Fed to gradually lift rates.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS inched 0.1 percent lower in early trade.\n\nOn Wall Street, stronger financial shares helped push up the S&P 500 .SPX, though the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI edged down.\n\nJapan's Nikkei stock index .N225 was up 1 percent, lifted by the weaker yen's tailwind.\n\n\"The dollar clearly rose on Yellen's remarks,\" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. \"But with tomorrow's inauguration of Trump ahead, Japanese investors still might take a cautious stance today.\"\n\nWhile market participants expect the incoming U.S. administration to embark on stimulus policies that would lift growth and inflation and keep the Fed on course for rate hikes, many investors are also concerned about the potential fallout of Trump's protectionist stance.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major counterparts, rose 0.4 percent to 101.31.\n\nThe dollar was firm against the yen at 114.66 JPY=, moving well above from the previous session's low of 112.57 yen.\n\nThe euro was also steady on the day at $1.0632 EUR= ahead of the European Central Bank's regular policy meeting later in the session, after the ECB surprised markets last month by saying it would trim its monthly bond purchases in April.\n\nNone of the economists polled by Reuters last week expected any change at Thursday's meeting. They were unanimous in saying that the ECB's next move, after April's planned cut, would be to further taper its quantitative easing.\n\nCrude oil prices took back ground lost in the previous session when the dollar strengthened. A stronger dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 added 0.7 percent to $51.46 per barrel, after shedding 2.67 percent on Wednesday.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Twaronite; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "keywords": ["index", "lower", "tokyo", "stronger", "hike", "jumps", "board", "dollar", "yellens", "shares", "rate", "asian", "japan", "stock", "signal", "outside"], "epoch": "1484804437", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "date": "20170119"}
