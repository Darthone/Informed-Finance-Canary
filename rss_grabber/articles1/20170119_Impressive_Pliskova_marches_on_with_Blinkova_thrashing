{"title": "Impressive Pliskova marches on with Blinkova thrashing", "text": "MELBOURNE Karolina Pliskova gave Russian teenager Anna Blinkova a massive wakeup call to the realities of grand slam tennis with a 6-0 6-2 Australian Open second round romp in just 59 minutes on Thursday.\n\nThe 18-year-old Blinkova ensured she did not suffer the dreaded 'double bagel' 6-0 6-0 scoreline in the fifth game of the second set when she held serve, with the crowd in Margaret Court Arena giving her a warm round of sympathetic applause.\n\nBlinkova, who came through qualifying and upset Romania's Monia Niculescu in the first round, broke into a huge grin and raised her left arm in mock triumph to salute the recognition.\n\nThe big-serving Pliskova, however, who was equally as dismissive of Spain's Sara Sorribes Tormo in the first round with a 6-2 6-0 victory, wrapped up the win over the grand slam debutant with her ninth ace.\n\n(Writing by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by John O'Brien)", "keywords": ["pliskova", "impressive", "blinkova", "marches", "win", "thrashing", "62", "60", "second", "slam", "grand", "wrapped", "round"], "epoch": "1484807674", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial"], "date": "20170119"}
