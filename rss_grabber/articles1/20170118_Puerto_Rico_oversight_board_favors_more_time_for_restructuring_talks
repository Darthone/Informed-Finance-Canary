{"title": "Puerto Rico oversight board favors more time for restructuring talks", "text": "Jan 18 Puerto Rico's federal oversight board said on Wednesday it was willing to extend key deadlines that would give the debt-laden U.S. territory's government more time to negotiate restructuring deals with holders of some $70 billion in bonds.\n\nIn a letter to Governor Ricardo Rossello, the oversight board said it \"is favorably inclined\" to grant the governor's request to extend to May 1 from Feb. 15 a freeze on litigation from creditors over missed debt payments. It also said it favored extending until Feb. 28 from Jan. 15 a deadline for Rossello to submit a fiscal turnaround plan for the island.\n\nBoth requests will be taken up formally \"later this month,\" the board said.
